# rivrbankMVC
rivrbankMVC is basically a model-view-controller PHP Framework.
It is completely open source. I created it to learn more about OOP in PHP and exactly how MVC works.
To use it:
There's a config.php file in apps/config where you would need to specify your own configurations.
Also in the .htaccess file in public, you'd need to tweak the RewriteBase.

I should probably write a documentation or something
